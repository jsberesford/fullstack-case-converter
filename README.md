This program uses for loops and if statements to test if certian characteristics are true in a users input, and adds them in an empty string to convert camelCase to snake_case, and vice versa. 
For example, to convert camelCase to snake case, it checks if the character is lowercase. If it is lowercase, it adds the character to the empty string. If it is uppercase, it adds an underscore
infront of the character, and continues. After continuing, it checks if the following character is lowercase, and continues the loop until the entire user input string is dealt with, then prints it out.
